There are multiple ways to break a singleton patter:
1. reflection Api :
    Get the constructor, change its access from private to public , call the constructor
    Solutions(Either return the same object or make sure object is not getting created)
     1. Throw run time exception in the constructor and do not allow the initialization if object is not null
     2. Use Enum in place of class and declare an instance
2. Serialization/Deserialization
3. Cloning
